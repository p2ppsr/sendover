# sendover

Tools for creating and paying invoices privately on Bitcoin SV

The code is hosted [on GitHub](https://github.com/p2ppsr/sendover) and the package is available [through NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/package/sendover).

## Installation

```
npm i sendover
```

## Example Usage

```js
const sendover = require('sendover')

// The merchant generates a keypair.
// They put the public key on their website, and keep the private key secret.
const merchantKeypair = sendover.generateKeypair()

// The customer also generates a keypair.
const customerKeypair = sendover.generateKeypair()

// The customer and the merchant agree on an invoice number.
// The customer knows the invoice number.
const purchaseInvoiceNumber = '341-9945319'

// The customer can now generate a Bitcoin addres for the payment.
// After generating the address, the customer sends the payment.
const paymentAddress = sendover.getPaymentAddress({
  senderPrivateKey: customerKeypair.privateKey,
  recipientPublicKey: merchantKeypair.publicKey,
  invoiceNumber: purchaseInvoiceNumber
})

// After making the payment, the customer sends a few things to the merchant.
// - The Bitcoin transaction that contains the payment
// - The invoice number they have agreed upon
// - The customer's public key
// - Any SPV proofs needed for the merchant to validate and accept the transaction
const dataSentToMerchant = {
  customerPublicKey: customerKeypair.publicKey,
  paymentTransaction: '...', // transaction that pays money to the address
  invoiceNumber: purchaseInvoiceNumber,
  transactionSPVProofs: ['...'] // Any needed SPV proofs
}

// The merchant can now calculate the private key that unlocks the money.
const privateKey = sendover.getPaymentPrivateKey({
  senderPublicKey: dataSentToMerchant.customerPublicKey,
  recipientPrivateKey: merchantKeypair.privateKey,
  invoiceNumber: dataSentToMerchant.invoiceNumber
})
```

### generateKeypair

Generates a public/private keypair for the sending and receiving of invoices.

Returns **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)** The generated keypair, with `privateKey` and `publicKey` properties.

### getPaymentAddress

Returns a payment address for use by the sender, given the recipient's public key, the sender's private key and the invoice number.

#### Parameters

*   `$0` **[Object](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object)**

    *   `$0.recipientPublicKey`  
    *   `$0.invoiceNumber`  

Returns **[String](https://developer.mozilla.org/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String)** The base58 Bitcoin address where the payment is to be sent.

### getPaymentPrivateKey

Returns a private key for use by the recipient, given the sender's public key, the recipient's private key and the invoice number.

#### Parameters
